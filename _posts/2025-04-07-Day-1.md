You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted **in non-decreasing order**, and two integers `m` and `n`, representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.

Merge `nums1` and `nums2` into a single array sorted in **non-decreasing order**.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be _stored inside the array_ `nums1`. To accommodate this, `nums1` has a length of `m + n`, where the first `m` elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last `n` elements are set to `0` and should be ignored. `nums2` has a length of `n`.

**Example 1**:
> Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
> Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
> Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
> The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.

**Example 2**:

> Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
> Output: [1]
> Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].
> The result of the merge is [1].

**Example 3**:

> Input: nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1
> Output: [1]
> Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [] and [1].
> The result of the merge is [1].
> Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.

Constraints:

- `nums1.length == m + n`
- `nums2.length == n`
- `0 <= m, n <= 200`
- `1 <= m + n <= 200-
- `-109 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 109`
 

Follow up: Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in `O(m + n)` time?

## Answer

```python
class Solution:
    def merge(self, nums1: List[int], m: int, nums2: List[int], n: int) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums1 in-place instead.
        """
        midx = m - 1
        nidx = n - 1
        right = m + n - 1

        while nidx >= 0:
            if midx >= 0 and nums1[midx] > nums2[nidx]:
                nums1[right] = nums1[midx]
                midx -= 1
            else:
                nums1[right] = nums2[nidx]
                nidx -= 1
            
            right -= 1
```

## [Solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/solutions/5714203/video-simple-solution-coding-exercise)


The first important thing to understand is that `nums1` is being modified **in-place** inside the function. When you use `nums1[:]` or directly assign values to `nums1[idx]`, the changes will be reflected outside the function as well.

The second key point is that we want to avoid using `sort()` and instead solve the problem with **O(m + n)** time complexity. This can be a bit tricky.

To do this, we first define indices `midx` for `nums1` and `nidx` for `nums2`. According to the constraints, the total length of `nums1` is `m + n`. So, we can come up with the following strategy:  

If we start filling values **from the beginning**, smaller values in `nums1` might get overwritten before being compared or moved. Therefore, it is better to **fill from the end**, comparing the values from both arrays and placing the largest one at the rightmost available position in `nums1`.

This approach ensures that values in `nums1` that are greater than those in `nums2` are already positioned correctly within the `[m, m + n)` range, and inserting smaller values from `nums2` into the `[0, m)` range won't cause any issues.

Let’s walk through an example:

---

**Approach**

**Input:**  
`nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0]`, `m = 3`  
`nums2 = [2,5,6]`, `n = 3`

◽️ **Question:**  
How should we iterate through the input arrays?

My answer is: **from the end**. Why?

Because in `nums1`, we have values at index 0, 1, and 2. The smallest is 1, then 2. The next smallest value, 2, is in `nums2`.  
If we try to insert it at the front, like this:

`[1,2,2,0,0,0]`  
Then we lose the original `3`, which we might still need. Keeping that value temporarily is a bit messy, right?

But if we start from the end, we have empty spots at index 3, 4, and 5 in `nums1`. We can just place the larger values there, and no original data is lost.

Since both arrays are sorted in non-decreasing order, all we need to do is compare the last elements and insert the larger one at the current rightmost index.

Let’s see this in action:

```
           ↓     r
nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3
nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3　　　　　　　　　　　
           ↑
```

`r` is the index where the next largest number will be placed.  
First, compare `3` and `6`. Since `6 > 3`, we place `6` at index `r` and move both `r` and the `nums2` pointer backward:

```
       ↓   r
[1,2,3,0,0,6]
[2,5,6]
   ↑
```

Next, compare `3` with `5`:

```
     ↓ r
[1,2,3,0,5,6]
[2,5,6]
   ↑
```

Then compare `3` with `2`:

```
   ↓ r
[1,2,3,3,5,6]
[2,5,6]
 ↑
```

Now compare `2` with `2`. Let’s insert the one from `nums2`:

```
 ↓ r
[1,2,2,3,5,6]
[2,5,6]
↑
```

Now the pointer for `nums2` has reached `-1`, so the iteration ends.  
The final result is `[1,2,2,3,5,6]`.
